Since aging out of the system at 18 they no longer have access to the support they once had, and have faced prejudice and mistreatment from past shelters for being transgender. Like many others in this situation they have faced discriminination, trust and confidence issues which were significant barriers in pursuing education. Tiana loves photography and is curious about web design so when they heard about Toronto Tech Mentoring through a friend at their shelter, they contacted the TTM team to learn more. The program volunteers helped them to navigate their goals, understand their learning style, and customize a website project specifically for them that would allow them to gain hands on experience while learning the basics of web design. They really enjoyed it, and after completing their project, their mentors helped them explore web design as a career path."

She coordinated with her IT Department to have the laptops wiped and then donated to our program. When her co-workers heard about what she had done, they loved it, and decided to come up with new ways to get involved. The next year, the company decided to continue support by donating extra software licenses. Sam’s actions directly empowered participants who did not have access to the needed technology to learn."
